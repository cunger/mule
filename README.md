_mule_ is a prototype engine for multilingual natural logic, powered by [Grammatical Framework](http://www.grammaticalframework.org). It is still under development.

## Build and run

_mule_ is built using [stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack), so you can build and run an executable like this:

```
stack build
stack exec mule-exe
```

Or load it in GHCi like this:

```
stack ghci
> :load Main
> main
```
